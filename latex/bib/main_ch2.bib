We develop a strategy for identifying meaningful categories in textual corpora that span long historic durées, where terms, concepts, and language use changes. Our approach is able to account for the fluidity of discursive categories over time, and to analyze their continuity by identifying the discursive stream as the object of interest.},

  abstract = {The jury trial is a critical point where the state and its citizens come together to define the limits of acceptable behavior. Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-term, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

@online{telgarsky2011,
  title = {How to Compute {{KL}}-Divergence When {{PMF}} Contains 0s?},
  abstract = {I'll give a short answer and a long answer.

The short answer is that the KL divergence on multinomials is defined when they have only nonzero entries. When there are zero entries, you have two choices. (1) Smooth the distributions in some way, for instance with a Bayesian prior, or (similarly) taking the convex combination of the observation with some valid (nonzero) distribution. (The standard Bayesian approach is to use a Dirichlet prior, which amounts to treating each entry as a fraction ni/mni/m where m=∑inim=∑ini, and nini should be integer (but with your provided data this may get messy), and replacing these fractions with for instance (ni+1)/(m+|x|)(ni+1)/(m+|x|) where |x||x| is the number of atoms in the discrete distribution; the "convex combination" smoothing choice is similar, if xx is your observation and α∈(0,1]α∈(0,1], return αU|x|+(1−α)xαU|x|+(1−α)x where U|X|U|X| is the uniform distribution on |x||x| points.) (2) Employ heuristics throwing out all the values that do not make sense, as suggested above. While I acknowledge that (2) is a convention, it doesn't really fit with the nature of these distributions, as I will explain momentarily.

The longer answer is the mathematical reason why KL divergence can't handle these zeros, which requires information about Exponential family distributions (multinomial, gaussian, etc). Every exponential family distribution is defined relative to some base measure, and it must be nonzero everywhere on that base measure: this is true with multinomials, it is true with gaussians (covariance matrix must be full rank), etc. This arises because these distributions are the solution to an optimization problem which breaks down in the presence of those zeros. Anyway, so what needs to happen is that the relative base measure is the "tightest possible": in the case of multinomials, it is the uniform distribution on the nonzero entries, and in the Gaussian case, it is Lebesgue measure restricted to the affine subspace corresponding to the eigenspace of the provided covariance, shifted by the provided mean. The KL divergence (written as an integral) only makes sense if both distributions are relative to the same "tightest fit" measure.

To summarize, the invalidity of the formula in the presence of zeros isn't just some unfortunate hack, it is a deep issue intimately tied to how these distributions behave. The smoothing/Bayesian solution is thus better motivated: it nudges the distributions into validity. But many people simply choose to throw out those values (i.e., by erasing 0ln(0)0ln⁡(0) or aln(a/0)aln⁡(a/0) and writing 00 in its place).},

Our methods allow one to preserve, approximately, the underlying axiomatic relationships of information theory—in particular, consistency under arbitrary coarse-graining—that motivate use of these quantities in the first place, while providing reliability comparable to the state of the art for Bayesian estimators. We show how information-theoretic quantities allow for rigorous empirical study of the decision-making capacities of rational agents, and the time-asymmetric flows of information in distributed systems. We provide illustrative examples by reference to ongoing collaborative work on the semantic structure of the British Criminal Court system and the conflict dynamics of the contemporary Afghanistan insurgency.},
